This repository demonstrates a subtle but common bug in shell scripts that involves processing filenames containing spaces using the `find` command and a `while` loop. The script aims to locate and process files, but fails when filenames include spaces because of improper quoting. The solution shows how to correctly quote filenames to resolve this issue, ensuring robust handling of various filenames.
